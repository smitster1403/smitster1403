### Welcome to my github account.

### I am currently a Computer Science Major with the University of Calgary in my third year. Love working with tech hence my decision to go into Computer Science.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a website with some friends for a course project at UofC using SQL for the database, Javascript and REACT technologies for the fullstack development experience.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning REACT, Javascript and relearning SQL to explore interest as a fullstack developer.
